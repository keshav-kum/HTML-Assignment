Tag : A tag is a basic component of HTML used to define or describe content. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets. There are two main types of tags:

. Opening tag: Marks the beginning of an element. For example, `<p>` starts a paragraph.
. Closing tag: Marks the end of an element. It is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (`/`). For example, `</p>` ends the paragraph.

Elemnent: An element is a combination of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The element defines a part of the document structure. For instance, a paragraph element consists of an opening `<p>` tag, the text of the paragraph, and a closing `</p>` tag.

Here is example of element: 
                             <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

                             In this example:

                            . `<p>` is the opening tag.
                            . `This is a paragraph.` is the content.
                            . `</p>` is the closing tag.
